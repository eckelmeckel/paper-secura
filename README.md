# Paper: SECURA: Unified Reference Architecture for Advanced Security and Trust in Safety Critical Infrastructures

Our paper "[SECURA: Unified Reference Architecture for Advanced Security and Trust in Safety Critical Infrastructures](https://doi.org/10.1145/3664476.3664513)" by [Michael Eckel](mailto:michael.eckel@sit.fraunhofer.de) and [Sigrid GÃ¼rgens](mailto:sigrid.guergens@sit.fraunhofer.de) (all [Fraunhofer SIT](https://www.sit.fraunhofer.de/) and [ATHENE Center](https://www.athene-center.de/)) was first published at the 19th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security ([ARES 2024](https://www.ares-conference.eu/)), organized by [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/) in cooperation with the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/), Austria.

This repository contains the code and data referred to in the paper.

## Querying the VirusTotal Database with Linux IMA Logs

The VirusTotal database can be queried for vulnerabilities of binary executables based on a hash value.
For that purpose, it provides a REST API (<https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/>).
An Overview of the API can be found here: <https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/overview>.

An API key is required to use the API; please obtain one from <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us>.
The public API is limited to 500 requests per day and a rate of 4 requests per minute (see <https://docs.virustotal.com/reference/public-vs-premium-api>).

This proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation uses [Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)](https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/) logs to query the VirusTotal database for known vulnerabilities.

### Prerequisites and Docker Container

The PoC implementation has been tested under Ubuntu 22.04 on an x86 64-bit system (amd64) using Bash.
The required packages are `python3` and `python3-requests`:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-requests
```

Alternatively, a Docker container can be used to execute the script in a sandbox.

Build Docker image:

```bash
docker build \
    -t 'eckelmeckel/poc-ima-vuln:1.0.0' \
    --build-arg "uid=$(id -u)" \
    --build-arg "gid=$(id -g)" \
    .
```

Run Docker container:

```bash
docker run \
    -v "${PWD}:/home/bob/poc-ima-vuln" \
    -it --rm --init \
    'eckelmeckel/poc-ima-vuln:1.0.0'
```

### IMA Logs

There is an example IMA log available under `ima-logs/ascii_runtime_measurements.sample`.

For this PoC, the IMA log is required to use the ASCII (not binary) format and the `ima-ng` template with SHA-256.
For further details, see <https://sourceforge.net/p/linux-ima/wiki/Home/#enabling-ima-measurement>.

The IMA log of a system is typically accessible via the `/sys/kernel/security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements` character device.
You can store the system's current IMA log it in the `ima-logs` folder with:

```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements \
    > ima-logs/ascii_runtime_measurements
```

### API Key

Once you obtained an API key from <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us>, please put it in the file `virustotal-api-key.txt`.

### Usage

The PoC script usage is as follows (`python3 query-virus-total-db-with-ima-log.py -h`):

```text
usage: query-virus-total-db-with-ima-log.py [-h] [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--dry-run] ima_file_path api_key dest_folder

Query VirusTotal for information on a file identified by its hash value.

positional arguments:
  ima_file_path      The file path to the ASCII IMA log in expected format: 'ima-ng' with SHA-256.
  api_key            Your VirusTotal API key. Please obtain one from <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us>.
  dest_folder        The destination folder for the JSON results; one file per hash. Overwrites existing files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --timeout TIMEOUT  Timeout in seconds between processing entries. Must be a positive integer.
  --dry-run          Run the script in dry-run mode without querying the VirusTotal database.
```

Example invocation in *dry-run* mode (quit with Ctrl+C):

```bash
python3 query-virus-total-db-with-ima-log.py --timeout 2 --dry-run \
    ima-logs/ascii_runtime_measurements.sample "$(cat virustotal-api-key.txt)" \
    out/
```

Example invocation in *live* mode (quit with Ctrl+C):

```bash
python3 query-virus-total-db-with-ima-log.py --timeout 2 \
    ima-logs/ascii_runtime_measurements.sample "$(cat virustotal-api-key.txt)" \
    out/
```

Example outputs can be found in `example-out/`.

For logs with more than 500 entries, you have to stay within the daily limit of the VirusTotal free account.
You can use a timeout value of `175` seconds and should be fine.
